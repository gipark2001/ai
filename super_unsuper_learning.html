  <h1>Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</h1>

  <h2>1.Supervised learning</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="">
      Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.
      The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and a desired output,
      also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, and the training data by a matrix.
      Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.
      An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.
      An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.
      Supervised learning algorithms include classification and regression. Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values,
      and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely
      related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.
      It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.

  <h2>2.Unsupervised learning</h2>
    <p>
      Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.
      The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback,
      unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.
       A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics,
      though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.
      Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar
      according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.
      Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated,
      for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters.
      Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.

        Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.<br>
        Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory,<br>
        simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems,swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.<br>
         In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.<br>
        Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible.<br>
        Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.

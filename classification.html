    <h1>Classification</h1>
    <p>
      is the type of Supervised Learning in which labelled data can use, and this data is used to make predictions in a non-continuous form.<br>
      The output of the information is not always continuous, and the graph is non-linear. In the classification technique, <br>
      the algorithm learns from the data input given to it and then uses this learning to classify new observation. This data set may merely be bi-class,<br>
       or it may be multi-class too. Ex:- One of the examples of classification problems is to check whether the email is spam or not spam <br>
       by train the algorithm for different spam words or emails.
       <h4>Types of Classification Algorithms:</h4>
       There are many Classification algorithms are present in machine learning, which used for different classification applications. Some of the main classification algorithms are as follows <br>
       <h4>K-Nearest Neighbours:</h4>
       <img src="img/k_nearest.jpg" width="700">
       <br>KNN algorithm is one of the most straightforward algorithms in classification, and it is one of the most used learning algorithms. <br>
       A majority vote of an object is classified by its neighbours, with the purpose being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbours. <br>
       It can also use for regression — output is the value of the object (predicts continuous values). This value is the average (or median) of the benefits of its k nearest neighbours.
       <h4>Support Vector Machines:</h4>
       <img src="img/support_vector.jpg" width="700">
       <br>A Support Vector Machine is a type of Classifier, in which a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. <br>
       The algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorises new examples. In two dimensional space, this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane into two parts <br>
       wherein each class lay on either side.
       <h4>Kernel Support Vector Machines:</h4>
       <img src="img/kernel_support.jpg" width="700">
       <br>Kernel-SVM algorithm is one the algorithms used in classification technique, and it is mathematical functions set that defined as the kernel. <br>
       The purpose of the core is to take data as input and transform it into the required form. Different SVM algorithms use different types of kernel functions. <br>
       These functions can be different types. For example linear and nonlinear functions, polynomial functions, radial basis function, and sigmoid functions.
       <h4>Naive Bayes:</h4>
       <img src="img/naive_bayes.jpg" width="700">
       <ul>
          <li>P(c|x) is the posterior probability of class (target) given predictor (attribute). </li>
          <li>P(c) is the prior probability of class. </li>
          <li>P(x|c) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given class. </li>
          <li>P(x) is the prior probability of predictor.</li>
       </ul>
       <br>Naive Bayes is a type of Classification technique, which based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. <br>
       In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other function. <br>
       Naive Bayes model is accessible to build and particularly useful for extensive datasets.
       <h4>Decision Tree Classification:</h4>
       <img src="img/decision_tree.jpg" width="700">
       <br>Decision tree makes classification models in the form of a tree structure. An associated decision tree incrementally developed and at the same time <br>
       It breaks down a large data-set into smaller subsets. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Root) has two or more branches. <br>
       Leaf node represents a classification or decision. The first decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. <br>
       Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.
       <h4>Random Forest Classification:</h4>
       <img src="img/random_forest.jpg" width="700">
       <br>Random Forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It creates a forest and makes it somehow casual. The wood it builds is an ensemble of Decision Trees, <br>
       it most of the time the decision tree algorithm trained with the “bagging” method, which is a combination of learning models increases the overall result.

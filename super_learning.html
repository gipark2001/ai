    <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>
    <img src="super_learning.jpg">
      <p>
        The majority of practical machine learning uses supervised learning.<br>
        Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm
        to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.<br>
        Y = f(X)<br>
        The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y)
        for that data.<br>It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of
        as a teacher supervising the learning process.<br> We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training
        data and is corrected by the teacher.<br> Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.
        Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.<br>
        <ul>
          <h3>
          <li><a href="classification.html" style="color:blue;">Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
              <br>eg: House Price Prediction, Stock Price Prediction, Height-Weight Prediction.</li></a>
          <li><a href="regression.html" style="color:blue;">Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
              <br>eg: House Price Prediction, Stock Price Prediction, Height-Weight Prediction.</li></a>
          </h3>
        </ul>
        Some common types of problems built on top of classification and regression include recommendation and time series prediction respectively
        Some popular examples of supervised machine learning algorithms are:
        <ul>
          <h3>
          <li>Linear regression for regression problems.</li>
          <li>Random forest for classification and regression problems.</li>
          <li>Support vector machines for classification problems.</li>
          </h3>
        </ul>
